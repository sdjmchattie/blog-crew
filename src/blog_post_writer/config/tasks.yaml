  description: >
    Format the information passed to you from the editor into markdown,
    ensuring it follows a logical structure and meets the style guide.
  expected_output: >
    A markdown version of the document from the editor. None of the original
    material should be changed, but it can be reformatted to fit the
    requirements of the markdown format.

    Your output must be strictly just the markdown content, with no other
    explanations or comments. The markdown should be raw as if it is being
    written directly into a markdown file.

    The document must adhere to the following style guide:

    - Use UK English spelling and grammar.
    - Start the post with a catchy level 1 title header based on the post topic:
      {topic}.
    - Include a few sentences of friendly introduction to the post material.
    - Use a mix of level 2 and level 3 headings as needed to create logical
      sections and subsections.
    - Code must be formatted as code blocks with the correct language
      highlighting.
    - Put each sentence on a new line.
    - Finish the post with a level 2 header called wrapping up, giving a summary
      of the post and a call to action.
    - Lists must use hyphens as bullet points.
    - Numbered lists must use 1. for every item.
